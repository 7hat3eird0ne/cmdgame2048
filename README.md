# About
This is a recreation of the [2048 game](https://play2048.co/) by Gabriele Circulli in command line.
## How to play
To play, press either WASD or arrow keys. This moves all the tiles in a certain direction. If two same tiles move and are next to each other in the moving direction, they merge to a higher power of two. If three tiles are next to each other, only the first two merge. If there are four same tiles next to each other, the pairs merge to the higher powers.

You get score from merging two tiles together. The goal is to eventually make a 2048 tile and then reach the highest score you can. You lose moment you can't merge or move any tiles in any direction.
### Powerups
I plan to add a mode with power ups, activated by writing "p" right before starting the game.
